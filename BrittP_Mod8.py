Step 01: Write a Python script that takes as input (at the command line) the name of a comma-separated variable (CSV) file containing 2 columns and an arbitrary number of rows. The file in question is linked above. The first column is the predictor variable, and the second column is the response variable. The Python script should read that file and store each column in a separate python array.

Hint: see the I/O (input / output) section of the online numpy documentation

Step 02: Use the numpy polyfit function to determine the coefficients of a first, second, and third order polynomial function to the data

Step 03: Create a plot that shows the fit polynomial functions (first, second, and third order) as lines and the original X and y data as points on the same plot
